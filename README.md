# Presenting: OLM Parser

## OLM Structure

This was determined through trial and error using test archive from a university email account
so it may not be completely representative. 

It looks like a zipped `xml` file, so we're able to navigate it as a tree. 

### Top Level:
* `Categories.xml` categories are a feature in outlook that let you colour code your emails. 
* `Accounts` is probably what you're interested in, it's where all your account's emails have been put
* `Local` is where previously created archives can be found
